This repo will hold various challenges including an interactive tester to see if they solved it right.

# Contents

## Django application
The django_application folder contains the CTF club project itself and all of the related code for the interactive system. 

It is licensed under the AGPLv3 for most of the code and the libCTF module is LGPLv3.

## the rest
Since this site is hosted via gh-pages the html and similar parts are there for that old gh-pages version of this site.
