e=173(So that you can see it in reverse).

Challenge #3
Crack the following message. The same messsage was sent twice to two recipients. Both messages were encrypted with the same value of n. This message was encoding using Radford's encoding method. Aka Naive ASCII.

They are in the order C1, e1 then C2, e2. And finally n.
